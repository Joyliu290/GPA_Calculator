# GPA_Calculator
I created this app in my spare time back in November in hopes to finish it by January so that I can calculate my final GPA.

Version 1 of this app is now complete. This app lets the users calculate their GPA, and can populate 2 columns, which includes the entry number, and the actual calculated GPA that the users wish to save in the database. The data in the ListView is organized from oldest to newest as the users scroll down. 

Below are the steps to see the main Java codes:
 1. Click "app", click "src", select "main"
 2. Click "java", then "com", then "example"
 3. Select "joyli", then "firstproject"

Step 3 will take you to a drop-list of all the java files for all the activities. 

For Version 2, I plan to record the date of entry of each data, and replace the date with the "entry number" in the listview, and add a button that clears all the data.
