# GPA_Calculator
Below are the steps to see the main Java codes:
 1. Click "app", click "src", select "main"
 2. Click "java", then "com", then "example"
 3. Select "joyli", then "firstproject"

Step 3 will take you to a drop-list of all the java files for all the activities. The SQL database alongside with a ListView are compelete and I'm hoping to also track the date of entry when the user calculates their GPA. I'm currently fixing small errors with the layout of the activities, and I will add an Intent button in the listview activity so that users can go back to the main calculation page.
