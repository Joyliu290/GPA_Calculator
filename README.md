Below are the steps to see the main Java codes:
 1. Click "app", click "src", select "main"
 2. Click "java", then "com", then "example"
 3. Select "joyli", then "firstproject"

The title of each activity are self-explanatory, and feel free to help me build a SQL database or edit codes as you wish.
