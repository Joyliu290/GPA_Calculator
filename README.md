# GPA_Success
I created this app in my spare time back in November in hopes to finish it by January so that I can calculate my final GPA and put it on the app store to help other university students.

A student-friendly app that was made with the intention to let students see and improve their academic progress through frequent calculation and viewing of their past calculated GPA.

This app lets students calculate their GPA for up to 5 courses based on their course percentages and course weightings. This app also offers the option to save the calculated GPA as per user's request

Version 1 of this app is now complete. This app lets users calculate their GPA, and can populate 2 columns, which includes the date of entry, and the actual calculated GPA that the users wish to save in the database. The data in the ListView is organized from oldest to newest as the users scroll down.

Now I have just published this app and it is now available on Google Play!
